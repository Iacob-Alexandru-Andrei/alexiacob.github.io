summary: >-
  I am an ML Research Scientist working on optimization and large-scale model
  training across geographically distributed infrastructure.
about:
  - >-
    I am a third-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of
    Cambridge, advised by Dr. Nicholas Lane, and a Research Scientist at Flower Labs.
  - >-
    My research spans machine learning methods from optimization to systems-aware
    training across long-distance distributed settings, with a focus on making
    large-model development efficient and reliable.
  - >-
    I build practical training methods, analyze convergence and robustness, and
    publish work that can transfer from research settings into production ML workloads.
