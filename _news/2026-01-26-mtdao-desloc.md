MT-DAO and DES-LOC were published at ICLR 2026, introducing two complementary local-update adaptive optimizer families: MT-DAO addresses multi-timescale momentum mismatch in low-communication training, while DES-LOC decouples synchronization of parameters and moments for provable, bandwidth-efficient, fault-tolerant scaling.
