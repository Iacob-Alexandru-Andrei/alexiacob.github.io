🚨 Our paper, DEPT: Decoupled Embeddings for Pre-Training Language Models, has been accepted for an Oral Presentation at hashtag#ICLR2025, taking place at the Singapore EXPO from April 24–28! 🇸🇬🎤

This work is the result of a fantastic collaboration between University of Cambridge and Flower Labs, and we can’t wait to share it with the community! 🙌

🔍 What makes DEPT stand out?

✅ Decoupled Embeddings: DEPT separates the embedding matrices from the transformer core, leading to a 4–5x reduction in memory usage
✅ Vocabulary-Agnostic: Supports custom vocabularies across data sources without needing a shared tokenizer
✅ Sync-Free Embeddings: Opens the door to efficient large-scale training in distributed or federated environments

🧠 We see DEPT as a foundational shift in how we approach pre-training for language models—enabling greater efficiency, flexibility, and scalability across distributed datasets.

🙏 Special thanks to our incredible collaborators for their dedication in bringing DEPT to life!
